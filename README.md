# ME 303 â€“ Project 2: Transient Heat Transfer in Avian Eggs

This repository contains MATLAB code, plots, and documentation for **Project 2** in **ME 303: Numerical Methods for Mechanical Engineers** at the University of Waterloo. The project applies **finite difference methods** to model **transient heat conduction** in biological systems â€” specifically, in bird eggs during incubation.

## ðŸ¥š Project Description

The goal of this project is to simulate temperature profiles in **quail, chicken, and ostrich eggs** using one-dimensional heat conduction models. The project considers:
- Egg-specific dimensions and thermal properties
- Time-dependent heat conduction using **explicit finite difference schemes**
- Radial temperature gradients and time-based heating profiles
